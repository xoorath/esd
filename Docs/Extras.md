## Other solutions

The [Express](https://expressjs.com/) project has put together a great list of template engines: https://expressjs.com/en/resources/template-engines.html


## Contributing Philosophy

If you're thinking of contributing to the project, keep these guidelines in mind:

1. ESD is designed to be easy to compile.
2. The feature-poor nature of ESD is by design.
3. We do not forgive syntax errors.
    * Incorrect usage should be pointed out, not supported.
4. We do not support every compiler, compiler version or platform.
    * We support Windows with VS2019 and Unix platforms with Ninja.

## What else can ESD do?

Although designed for use with static websites ESD doesn't actually care what text files you use it with. It could theoretically be used for any kind of include and variable substitution.
