# DIY

esd is designed to be simple to build too. If your C++ compiler supports c++20 you can likely drag and drop the files from `/Source/*` into a build environment and build it with little to no configuration.

# Cmake

We [create builds](/.github/workflows) of esd with [cmake](https://cmake.org/).
